    And he should see that a context named "OutAndAbout" is present

    And I should see "changed"

    When I go to the the context page for "@pc"
    And I edit the context of "todo 1" to "@laptop"
    Then I should not see "todo 1"
    And the badge should show 1

    Then I should see "todo 1"
    And I should see "todo X"
    And the badge should show 2
